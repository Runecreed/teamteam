# Purpose

the repository will hold our web application. Version Control integration is useful for team programming.

Make sure you install git
https://git-scm.com/downloads

after that you should be able to use the version history control modules in your favorite developer tools (Atom, Netbeans, Intellij).

basic usage of git:

Clone this repository 

git clone https://github.com/Runecreed/teamteam/

now you have a local setup for coding.
To make changes to the repository, simply write a commit via your IDE or the command line

git commit <yourmessage>

you now have a version of your code available to push onto the repository, you can do so in your IDE's Version control panel
or via the terminal by writing

git push origin master

to push your local copy to the master branch in the repository's remote location (which is generally called origin).
Note that this can only push a COMMIT, if you make changes after writing a COMMIT (bascially saying you have a satisfactory version of your program), it will complain that there are changes uncommited, when this happens you need to write a new commit and push after.
